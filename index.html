      <p>My name is Sara Overby. In the late 90s, my friends and I taught ourselves web design and development. Life took me away from coding, but the DU Coding Bootcamp gave me an exciting opportunity to jump back in. I have a Masters Degree in Public Administration from the University of Colorado. I am passionate about the work of public and nonprofit sectors.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Currently I work in philanthropy as a Program Officer at the Colorado Health Foundation. As part of my work, I travel to meet with municipal and community leaders in Southwestern Colorado, including the beautiful towns of Cortez, Durango, and Salida. At the Foundation I have funded telehealth projects to increase access to health care services in rural areas, renovations of buildings and playgrounds, and community groups working on advocacy and social justice issues for indigenous people, immigrants, and people of color.</p>
      <br>
      <p>My husband and I live in the East Colfax neighborhood with our strong-willed daughter, three dogs, and a big ol' cabinet of board games.</p>
